## Shared Code Exercises
Courses like C have code which is unsuitable to host on this wiki. For this reason a GitHub organization has been created to host the code. [Thomas More EICT GitHub](https://github.com/tm-eict). Feel free to open a pull requests! If you need direct write access to these repositories send me a message on Discord Xunafay#0001.
