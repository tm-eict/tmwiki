# Ports
## Dangers?
You can find this information at p131-134.
### USB ports and devices
USB devices can be very small which means they are easy to hide and transport. This makes it easy for they to carry/inject malicious software into local host computers.
That's why its very important to protect USB ports in a computer, as well as controlling access of individuals.

### eSATA ports
External SATA (Serial AT Attachment) are ports connected to the system's internal SATA bus. This bus is a standard for connecting hard drives to the computer system. Since they provide direct access to the buses that connect hard drives, they are security concern and might be worth covering up.

### Legacy ports
Serial COM ports, Small Compuiter System Interface (SCSI) and LPT parallel printer ports pose a security risk since they are all capable of handling two-way communications with the system's internal devices
